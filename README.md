## ReAnimating

### About
React native reanimated 2 has been a game changer since it's release, the idea behind this project it's to re-invent animations from real world apps, designs or code challenges with it.

### Known problems and limitations
- Binding `onScroll` values from scrollable components like `ScrollView` or `FlatList` to animate any given properties causes a screen flickering on Android, therefore a custom implementation of a scrollable component is required.

### Animations
Each animation subfolder has a `README.md` file explaning some details and decisions taken behind the creation process if any and gifs showing showing how the animation looks like.
